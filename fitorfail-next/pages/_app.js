	// This context stuff took me way too long to figure out since context is cleared on refreshes.
	// I have no idea if this is the most efficient way of doing things, but as far as I can tell, it's working fine,
	// and we now have essentially persistent global userData based on the User's token that's stored as a cookie upon login.
	// Hopefully this continues to work for whatever it might be needed for.
